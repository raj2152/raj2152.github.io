## A little bit about me...     
I received a BS in Cognitive Science from UCLA in 2018 and am currently pursing my MPH at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I am a second year MPH student in the Department of Health Policy & Management with a certificate in Applied Biostatistics and Public Health Data Science.
